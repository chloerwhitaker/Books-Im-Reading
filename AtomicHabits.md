# Atomic Habits by James Clear

## Introduction

    - "A habit is a routine or behavior that is preformed regularly-and, in many cases, automatically." 
    - "I never ended up playing [baseball] professionally. However, I believe I accomplished something just as rare: I fullfilled my potential. And I believe the concepts in this book can help you fulfill your potential as well." 
    - "...chamges that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you're willing to stick to them for years."
    - "...the quality of our lives often depend on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you'll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible." 

## Chaper 1 - The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
    - "[they] continued to find 1 percent improvements in overlooked and unexpected areas... As these and hundreds of other small improvements accumulated, the results came faster than anyone could have imagined."
    - "It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action."
    - "Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn't particularly notable-sometimes it isn't even noticible-but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run." 
    - "...if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you'll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you're done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you'll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more. Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement."
    - "Making a choice that is 1 percent better or worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily habits_ not a once-in-a-lifetime transformation." 
    - "Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits." 
    - Summarixed: Don't set goals to produce change - change your system instead. A goal has both winners and losers, but a winning systemn is what helps a person to succeed at their goals.
