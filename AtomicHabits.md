# Atomic Habits by James Clear

## Introduction

    - "A habit is a routine or behavior that is preformed regularly-and, in many cases, automatically." 
    - "I never ended up playing [baseball] professionally. However, I believe I accomplished something just as rare: I fullfilled my potential. And I believe the concepts in this book can help you fulfill your potential as well." 
    - "...chamges that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you're willing to stick to them for years."
